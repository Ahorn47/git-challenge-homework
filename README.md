User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

I challenged myself to set HTML to specific semantic elements that are structured to have substance. I have READ the challenges and i commited my changes acccordingly . Deleted alot of insertions and still need to work on development of HTML sematic structure in order for it to align to my CSS selector. I found changes t be made from the header and footer. Moved the div tags to other semantic elements. I made a mistake that i used css selector to create my own form of display page but by carefully reading i accordingly established a good moral ground and do need some work to finalize.
