# git-challenge-homework
I challenged myself to set HTML to specific semantic elements that are structured to have substance. I have READ the challenges and i commited my changes acccordingly . Deleted alot of insertions and still need to work on development of HTML sematic structure in order for it to align to my CSS selector. I found changes t be made from the header and footer. Moved the div tags to other semantic elements. I made a mistake that i used css selector to create my own form of display page but by carefully reading i accordingly established a good moral ground and do need some work to finalize.
